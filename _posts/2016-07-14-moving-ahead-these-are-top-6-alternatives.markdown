## Life is too short to be anything but happy, Love deeply, forgive quickly, take chances, give everything with no regrets, Forget the past with exception of what you have learned and remember everything happens for a reason.
> Ask your self a question, whats in store for you, you'll definitely move along.

#### Paragraphs are the most used block-level elements. One or more consecutive lines of text are interpreted as one paragraph. The first line of a paragraph may be indented up to three spaces, the other lines can have any amount of indentation because paragraphs support line wrapping. In addition to the rules outlined in the section about line wrapping, a paragraph ends when a definition list line is encountered.

#### You can separate two consecutive paragraphs from each other by using one or more blank lines. Notice that a line break in the source does not mean a line break in the output (due to the lazy syntax)!. If you want to have an explicit line break you need to end a line with two or more spaces or two backslashes! Note, however, that a line break on the last text line of a paragraph is not possible and will be ignored. Leading and trailing spaces will be stripped from the paragraph text.####

#### A blockquote is started using the > marker followed by an optional space and the content of the blockquote. The marker itself may be indented up to three spaces. All following lines, whether they are started with the blockquote marker or just contain text, belong to the blockquote because blockquotes support line wrapping.
